## 🌟 What is R-Shop?

R-Shop is a Flutter-based Android application that provides a **seamless, console-like experience** for browsing, downloading, and organizing your retro game library. 

It bridges the gap between your self-hosted storage (**RomM, SMB, FTP, Web**) and your handheld device, providing a native UI that feels like it was built by a major console manufacturer. Optimized specifically for the **AYN Odin, Retroid Pocket, Anbernic** and other Android-based handhelds.

> **🛡️ Neutrality Policy:** R-Shop is a technical tool and directory browser. It does **not** host, distribute, or provide links to copyrighted content. You provide the sources; R-Shop provides the experience.
